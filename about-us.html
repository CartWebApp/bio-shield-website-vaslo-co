    <p>Our story begins when a group consisting of our CEO, advertisers and scientists came togtherwith one goal in mind:to revolutionize a new bugspray that is:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Environmentally friendly</li>
<li>User friendly</li>
<li>And importantly, renewable!</li>
    </ul>
<p>To begin our research, we partnered with ecolife, a company that spends most of their time in the Amazonian rainforests, where they study and continue to discover how specific plant-life affects specfic animals.</p>
<br>
<p>After 5 years of researching, we had discovered the perfect bugspray for our company. And thus came Bioshield, which started small in one town known to have bug issues:Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>
<br>
<p>And after year of success in Chicago, we have expanded! We have brought our product to places like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
<li>Philidephia</li>
<li>Chicago</li>
<p>And more!</p>

<aside>
<p>We don't just operate in the U.S either, we have the same products in countries such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spain</li>
    <li>The UK</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>Australia</li>
    <li>Japan!</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>That brings us now to the present day, where we are a global company committed to removing your bug problems, both at home and in the outdoors! Thank you for reading our history, happy trails!</p>
