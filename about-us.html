 <h1>Our History</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Where It Begins</h2>
        <p><strong>Our story begins when a group consisting of our CEO, advertisers and scientists came together with one goal in mind:</strong> to revolutionize a new bug spray that is environment-friendly, user-friendly, and renewable.</p>

        <p>To begin our research, we partnered with Ecolife, a company that studies plant life in the Amazon rainforest and how it affects specific animals.</p>

        <h2>Small Steps</h2>
        <p>After 7.5 years of research we discovered a formulation that met our goals and launched BioShield in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.</p>

        <h2>The Expansion</h2>
        <p>After success in Chicago, we expanded to cities such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Los Angeles</li>
            <li>Philadelphia</li>
            <li>Chicago</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Going Global</h2>
        <p>We now operate internationally in countries including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spain</li>
            <li>The UK</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Japan</li>

    <p>Our story begins when a group consisting of our CEO, advertisers and scientists came togtherwith one goal in mind:to revolutionize a new bugspray that is:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Environmentally friendly</li>
<li>User friendly</li>
<li>And importantly, renewable!</li>
    </ul>
<p>To begin our research, we partnered with ecolife, a company that spends most of their time in the Amazonian rainforests, where they study and continue to discover how specific plant-life affects specfic animals.</p>
<br>
<p>After 5 years of researching, we had discovered the perfect bugspray for our company. And thus came Bioshield, which started small in one town known to have bug issues:Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>
<br>
<p>And after year of success in Chicago, we have expanded! We have brought our product to places like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
<li>Philidephia</li>
<li>Chicago</li>
<p>And more!</p>
